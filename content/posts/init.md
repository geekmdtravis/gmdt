## TL;DR - Travis Nesbit, MD, MS Candidate (CS)

Undergrad in bio. Graduated UC Irvine School of Medicine in 2013. Completed an internal medicine residencey program in 2016. I maintain a valid ABIM certification and am certiifed by the Medical Board of California. I enjoyed "medicine", but not working in the medical industry. I taught myself software engineering and have been finding ways to improve medicine at scale ever since. I currently work at the California Correctional Health Care Services, Headquarters, Medical Services Division. I function as the lead software engineer for our team, though my official state title is **Physician & Surgeon**. I'm actively wrapping up a masters in computer science at Georgia Tech, and engaged in research in the health AI field at Emory in the Madabhushi lab.

## Favorite Stuff

1. Hobby - Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
2. Video game - Starcraft 2
3. Food - Sushi
4. Career - SWE > MD
5. Code editor - NeoVim ([my starter](https://github.com/geekmdtravis/nvchad-starter-personalized))
6. Programming language - Don't have one, but I use Python and TypeScript the most.
7. Operating System - Linux for development, MacOs for daily driving.
8. Linux Distribution - Arch Linux for ricing, Pop_OS! for out-of-the-box goodness.

## Thoughts on Other Stuff

### Medicine

```tsx
const days = [
  "monday",
  "tuesday",
  "wednesday",
  "thursday",
  "friday",
  "saturday",
  "sunday",
];

days.forEach((d) => facePalm(d));
```

Despite significant spending, medicine is in a dire state. While I enjoy helping the patients I see when I do my half-day clinics (to keep my skills sharp), I'm not a fan of the practice and only keep up so that I can keep my clincal skills sharp as they aid my development.

AI, or machine learning, may become the solution, though not necessarily the desired one. I find it fascinating, but I understand its potential intimidation.

### AI (in Medicine)

We say “AI,” but we mean many forms of machine learning. Regardless, AI has problems in healthcare. First, data is hard to get. While AI model architecture matters, data drives its effectiveness. We need to revisit medical data laws for more data to fill human gaps with technology. Second, domain expertise is crucial for model creation and training, but few clinicians are involved. Third, people fear AI because they don’t understand it.

I am of the position that AI belongs in medicine, and I am doing what I can to improve affordable access to high value care all over the world through technological innovation in the health AI space.

### Software Engineering

Software engineering is an incredibly enjoyable field! Once you gain some proficiency, the possibilities are endless. And, there’s always something new and exciting to learn. In my opinion, AI has further enhanced the appeal of software engineering. It has streamlined much of the repetitive work and serves as a versatile reference that you can access immediately and in context, thanks to tools like Aider, Cline, CoPilot, Q, and so on.

However, I believe that true greatness in software engineering requires a genuine passion for the field and its intricacies. I firmly believe that individuals who embrace configurable environments that allow for close interaction with the underlying tooling of their development environment will not only become better software engineers but also faster and more efficient ones.

In essence, I advocate for choosing Linux as your operating system whenever possible and opting for code editors like VSCode, NeoVim, and so on instead of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
